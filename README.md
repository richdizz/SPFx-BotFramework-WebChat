### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
gulp serve
```

This package produces the following:

* lib/* commonjs components - this allows this package to be reused from other packages.
* dist/* - a single bundle containing the components used for uploading to a cdn pointing a registered Sharepoint webpart library to.
* example/* a test page that hosts all components in this package.
